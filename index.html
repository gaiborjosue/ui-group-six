    <h1>Car Maintenance & Info Webpage</h1>
    <p><strong>1. Group Name:</strong> Car Maintenance & Info Webpage<br>
    <strong>Group Members:</strong> Tyler Nguyen, Daniel Gross, Edward Gaibor</p>
    <p><strong>2. Problem:</strong> To consolidate all the information needed to maintain personal vehicles while providing additional insights that allow users to make informed decisions about their car.</p>
    <p>Users will be able to enter their vehicle information (Year, Make, Model, and Mileage), and the correct service intervals for fluid changes, tire rotations, and other vehicle maintenance tasks will be provided. Users will also be able to see an estimated value of their car based on the information entered.</p>
    <p>For an improved user experience, the website will ideally feature an interactive 3D model of a car rendered directly on the page. Users will be able to navigate and click on specific parts of the vehicle (e.g., engine, tires, brakes, battery) to view maintenance details, service intervals, and related information for that specific component. This will make the interface more intuitive, visual, and engaging.</p>
    <p><strong>Potential Obstacles:</strong> Accessing accurate vehicle maintenance data and real-time car valuation based on user input may be challenging. We will need to find reliable data sources for each vehicle. Another obstacle is designing and implementing a visually appealing and practical way for users to interact with their vehicle data, especially if incorporating a 3D interactive model.</p>
